Virtualenv 

Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository

Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 4: Configure the Database
The project uses PostgreSQL as the database. You will need to create a PostgreSQL database and user:

4.1 Create a PostgreSQL Database:
CREATE DATABASE bookhub_db;

4.2 Create a PostgreSQL User and Grant Privileges:
CREATE USER bookhub_user WITH PASSWORD 'secure_password'; <-- Change this to your own password
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE bookhub_db TO bookhub_user;
Update settings.py:

4.3 Edit the DATABASES section in settings.py to match your local setup:
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'bookhub_db',
        'USER': 'bookhub_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'secure_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}

Step 5: Apply Migrations
Run Django's migrations to set up your database:
python manage.py migrate


Step 6: Create a Superuser
Create a superuser to access the Django admin interface:
python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow the prompts to set up a username, email, and password.

Step 7: Collect Static Files
python manage.py collectstatic

Step 8: Run the Development Server
Start the Django development server:
python manage.py runserver

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your web browser to access the site. Log in using the superuser credentials you created to access the admin interface at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/.
